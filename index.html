    Hello, and welcome to my fanpage for the film <em>Inglourious Basterds</em>, directed by Quentin Tarantino!

  <h2>
    About Inglourious Basterds
  </h2>
  <p>
    <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> (henceforth abbreviated as IB) is a World War II film directed by Quentin Tarantino. It was released in theatres in 2009. The film stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and MÃ©lanie Laurent. The film is of the alternate history genre, meaning that it is based on history, but that its events also diverge from reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plot of IB is centered around a group of Jewish-American soldiers, called the "Basterds," plotting to assassinate Nazi leaders. Concurrently, a Jewish refugee, Shoshanna, who has escaped German-occupied France with only her life bides her time to get her revenge against the Nazis. Viewers watch as the Basterds and Shoshanna's respective plans unfold in what can only end in bloodshed (it's a Tarantino film, what did you expect)?

    Quotes from the movie (Spoilers!)
  </h3>
  <blockquote>
    Hans Landa: [giddy] Oooh, that's a bingo! Is that the way you say it? "That's a bingo?"<br>
    Aldo Raine: You just say "bingo."<br>
    Hans Landa: Bingo! How fun!
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Aldo Raine: Well, I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks the second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman. Omar speaks third most, so he'll be Donny's assistant.<br>
    Omar Ulmer: I don't speak Italian.<br>
    Lt. Aldo Raine: Like I said, third best. Just keep your !@#$in' mouth shut. In fact, why don't you start practicing, right now!
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    Aldo Raine: I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors. When you join my command, you take on debit. A debit you owe me personally. Each and every man under my command owes me one hundred Nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will git me one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazis. Or you will die tryin'.
