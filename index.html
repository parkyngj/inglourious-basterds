  <p>
    <em>Inglourious Basterds</em> (henceforth abbreviated as IB) is a World War II film directed by Quentin Tarantino. It was released in theatres in 2009. The film stars Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz, and MÃ©lanie Laurent. The film is of the alternate history genre, meaning that it is based on history, but that its events also diverge from reality.

    The plot of IB is centered around a group of Jewish-American soldiers, called the "Basterds," plotting to assassinate Nazi leaders. Concurrently, a Jewish refugee, Shoshanna, who has escaped German-occupied France with only her life bides her time to get her revenge against the Nazis. Viewers watch as the Basterds and Shoshanna's respective plans unfold in what can only end in bloodshed (it's a Tarantino film, what did you expect)?
